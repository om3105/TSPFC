AQI Analysis of Indian Cities (2020-2024)

📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes the Air Quality Index (AQI) trends of major Indian cities from 2020 to 2024. Using data visualization and statistical analysis, we aim to identify pollution patterns, seasonal variations, and the impact of different pollutants on AQI.

📂 Dataset

The dataset consists of AQI readings from multiple Indian cities, including:

Cities Covered: Bengaluru, Chennai, Delhi, Hyderabad, Kolkata, Mumbai, Gwalior, Jaipur, Lucknow

Parameters Analyzed: PM2.5, PM10, NO2, SO2, CO, O3, AQI

Timeframe: 2020 - 2024

🔧 Tech Stack

Python (Pandas, NumPy)

Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn

Jupyter Notebook

📊 Key Findings

Delhi & Kolkata have the highest AQI levels.

Winter months (Nov-Jan) show increased pollution.

Bengaluru & Chennai have relatively better air quality.

PM2.5 & PM10 strongly correlate with high AQI values.

🚀 How to Run the Notebook

Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Indian_Cities_AQI.git
cd Indian_Cities_AQI

Install dependencies:

pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn

Open the Jupyter Notebook:

jupyter notebook Indian_Cities_AQI.ipynb

📌 Future Scope

Integrating Machine Learning models to predict future AQI levels.

Real-time AQI monitoring with API integration.

Further analysis on government interventions & policy impact.
